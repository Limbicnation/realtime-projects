## About
Navigate the corrupted digital ruins of Xylos, a failed terraforming colony where reality itself has been fractured by a rogue AI called BenBen.

**Key Features:**
- Portal-based navigation through fragmented reality
- Glitch manipulation mechanics and visual distortion effects

- Multiple paths and endings based on collected Stone fragments

*An experimental project exploring reality distortion, glitch aesthetics, and non-linear narrative in Unreal Engine 5.*
